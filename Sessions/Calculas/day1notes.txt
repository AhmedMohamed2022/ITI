1-set theory
set: collection of distinct elements
magnitude: number of elements in set
empty Set: set with zero magnitude {} , Ø 
operations:-
reference: https://byjus.com/maths/set-theory-symbols/
 - element of (a ∈ A)
 - not element of (a ∉ A) only with ∈ that applies to element with Set
 - intersection (Y ∩ Z)
 - Union (A ∪ B)
 - proper subset/strict subset (A ⊂ B) all elements of A is part of B but has fewer elements that B
 - subset (A ⊆B) all elements of A is part of B and might has all elements of B (note A subset of B , B is super set of A)
 - not subset (Z ⊄ Y) all elements of Z aren't part of B
 - equality (A=B) both identical
 - complement (Ac ,A') 
 - relative complement (A-B) elements belong to A not B ==(A-(A ∩ B))

Properties of Sets:
 - Commutative law : A∪B = B∪A , A∩B=B∩A
 - Associative law: (A∪B)∪C=A∪(B∪C)
 - Distributive law: (A∪B)∩C=(A∩B)∪(A∪C)
  DeMorgan's laws:
	- (A∪B)'=A'∩ B'
	- (A∩B)'=A'∪ B'
2-Propability: The measure of the likelihood that an event will occure
  -It is quantified as a number between 0 and 1 where 0 indicates      impossibility and 1 indicates certainty.

  Sample space(S): set of all possible outcome from experiment.
  it is discrete if consists of sets
  it is continues if deals with intervals

  EX: throwing a dice:
 	S={1,2,3,4,5,6}
      Flipping a Coin:
	S={HH,HT,TH,TT}
          Draw 2 balls from box
	with replacement
	  S={RG,RR,RB,...}
	without replacement
	  S={RG,GR,...}
  Events : subset of the sample space of random experiment.
  we can use set operations with events .
   if E1∩E2=Ø (Mutually exclusive).
   equally likely , random experiment == not biased (all probabilities are chosen to be equal)
   - n possible events , probability of each event is 1/N
   - p(E)= sum of probabilities of elements in E (in equally likely case)
	- p(E) =mag(E)/mag(S)
   	- P(E1∪E2)=P(E1)+P(E2)-P(E1∩E2)
   
3-conditional probability:
	p(B|A)=p(B∩A)/p(A)
	p(B∩A)=p(B|A)*p(A)

4-total probability rule:
	p(B)=P(B∩A)+P(B∩A')
	p(B)=p(B|A)*P(A)+p(B|A')*P(A')
5-independent events:
	p(B∩A)=P(A)*P(B)
6-Bayes theory:
p(A|B)=[P(B|A)*P(A)]/P(B)
