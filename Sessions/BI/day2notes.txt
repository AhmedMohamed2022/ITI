ETL vs ELT
ELT
staging area/server-> transform->datawarehouse


warehourse -> denormalized(analysis only selecting) reduce joins and subquerys , historical,subject:measures oriended not
 
data oriended :any little details reflect all databse
integraed : many resours
time-varying: historical (date dimension per it)
non-volatile: doesn't re, dcesion making (insights to take descision) 


package: 
cubes: default sum, fact table,
xml in PI all in background as understand all data sources 
so can start with vendor and continue with other vendor

ETL tools
Teradata =>(ETL tool) Infromatica,
Oracle=> DWH builder
Power Query

analysis:
PowerPivot 
IBM framework manager

reporting:
Microsoft:-
Power View
Excel
PowerPI
Crystal Report
ProClarity
SharePoint
SSRS
IBM:- Congons Reporting 
Vodafone:- Sap Business Object
open sours:- Tableau


why OLAP

fast execution
no locking
query builder is done by SSIS not me
integration in one Datawarehouse (every one can see it in one place)

Data Marts: part of Data warehouse specific for business or section

dependent data mart: normal from existing Datawarehouse

independent .. .. : from measure(total sales) and dimensions (sales) of small departments to generate small Datawarehouse  

cubes: sub of datawarhouse or datamart has combination of calculation of aggregate Or (measure and dimensions)

OLAP (vs OLTP)online analytical processing : How analysis service (SSAS) transform Datawarehouse and data mart to cubes


level of gran
level then members
hierarchy year->quarter->month or any number of levels

snowflake schema 
one at least one normalized dimension
x->y
y->z
x->z

for can't denormalization situation

like many to many (in datawarehouse coure)

galaxy schema (realife example)
shared dimesion linking 2 fact tables
department ->measures ->fact table->dimensions= cubes(insights)

pivot tables:
row - columns-aggregate
2-dimensional cube, 3-dimensional cube

rollup-> less details , more aggregation
drill-down-> more details, less aggregation


db engine : dwh
analysis service 

OLAP
normal cube has :{dimension data + aggregation}

HOLAP
hyprid cube has :{aggregation}

ROLAP
structure cube has :{sturcture(only know what to gather and calculate)}
